    "A *class* is one of the basic building blocks of Python, it is a core concept in OOP which provides an approach to structuring programs/applications so that the data held and the operatios performed on that data *are bundled together into classes and accessed via objects*.\n",

    "Classes act as *templates* which are used to construct instannces or exmaples of a class of thigs. Each example of the class PERSON might have a name, an age, an address, etc. For exampel, an example of the class could be Paul, age=32, address='london'. \n",
