    "Packages tend to be larger (at least conceptually) units than classes, they are not used to encapsulate a single concept such as *string* or *Date*, but rather a whole set of related concepts (as indeed they are used in python). *Thus, a class is a finer level of granularity than a package*. \n",

    "Second, packages still provide a relatively loose association between the data and the procedures. They are realated via related set of concepts represented by the package. On the other hand, a class tends to closely relate data and methods in a single concept. Indeed one of the guidelines relationg to good class sign is that if a class represents more than one concept, then you should split it in two classes. \n",
